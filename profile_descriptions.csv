Profile Description
Hi there, I've spent the last 10 years working in hospitality and just recently moved to London. I'm looking for a new career path in tech and am excited to increase my knowledge through coding buddies!
Finished a very intensive coding bootcamp and now looking for a job as a junior software developer and my ultimate goal is to have my own product/app (a company/startup).
Hi, there! I have changed many jobs since I came to UK. most recently I was a chef which I would say is both rewarding but very stressful and time consuming job which is the main reason I have looked into learning to code and change my work/life balance. I am planning on learning to code, keep improving and prove that no matter the history you've had you can change, adapt and get better!
Have been running my own business with my better half for half a decade. Covid 19 sucks so decided to make the most of it and make some Lemonade. I am Looking forward to up skilling and learning some code!
I'm currently an accountant. Before this I was an Account Manager for Talk Talk. I left to focus more on my family. Reason I wanted to develop my skills with coding is that I've always been the person 'selling' the solution. I want to be the person who develops instead.
I am pursuing a career in the exciting world of Tech after travelling around the world for a few years. Prior to that I worked in marketing.
I graduated as web designer and worked as a teacher. As hobbies on the side, I started building Wordpress sites for my friends and some freelance clients but heavily relying on offshore web developers to fix plugins. That's how I got interested in coding... My career goal is to learn how to build tech products from scratch and join a tech startup with a global presence. I have particular interests in site speed optimisation, automation and technical SEO and web security
I have graduated with an Economics degree. I found a few cross overs with economics and coding, this is the main reason I wanted to pursue a career in this industry.

Used to work in marketing which is plagued by tedious processes - a good reason to learn to code to automate them!
Adventurer 🌎. I am incredibly excited to be starting on my coding journey and look forward to seeing where this amazing new path will take me! I do not come from a traditional career background.

I am open to new opportunities and ideas. 🤙

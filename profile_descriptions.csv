Hi, there! I have changed many jobs since I came to UK in 2014. most recently I was a delivery driver which I would say is both rewarding but very stressful and time consuming job which is the main reason I have looked into learning to code and change my work/life balance. I am planning on learning to code, keep improving and prove that no matter the history you've had you can change, adapt and get better!
Have been running my own property services business with my better half for half a decade. Covid 19 sucks so decided to make the most of it and make some Lemonade. I am Looking forward to up skilling and learning some code!
I'm currently a Trustee of a charity my friend started called 'Lymphoma Out Loud'. Before this I was an Account Executive for the video platform Zoom. I was one of the first 10 people in UK. I left to focus more on the charity. Reason I wanted to develop my skills with coding is that I've always been the person 'selling' the solution. I want to be the person who develops instead.

I have particular interests in site speed optimisation, automation and technical SEO and web security.Ex Service Engineer, looking to change career into Web Development or Software Programming.

Hello fellow buddies! I recently just graduated in Economics, and have always had a passion to code!!!! Really looking forward to getting stuck in and hopefully land myself a career in the field after completion.
Given the way humans are embracing technology, I want to learn to code because it is the equivalent of learning to read a few hundred years ago. I am interested in the overlap between entrepreneurship and tech.

Afterwards, I co-founded my own startup with a couple of good friends and coders. These days I spend my days reading, running, cycling and upskilling in different areas of technology.
Throughout my Business Administration studies in Madrid I directed my degree towards topics in technology and digital innovation. That's where I obtained first insights into coding and became eager to improve my skills as well as gain deeper insights into that field. I hope that codebuddies will help me to kickstart my career in consulting and support my entrepreneurial ambitions as well.
